- document an easy way to hack on wixl, using WiX and msi diff
- write a tool checking the Internal Consistency Evaluators - ICEs

- make a SummaryInformation API that does not suck (including converting
  FILETIME usage to GDateTime)
- add an API to open a query and return a pointer to the next SQL
  statement in the passed string
- add a SQL tool with readline
- add API to import from a string
- split regression tests into many smaller harnesses, possibly using 
  gtester
- add tests for msiinfo
